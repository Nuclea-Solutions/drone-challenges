 # Drone Challenges

This repository contains a few challenges around Drones, the idea is to focus
on any challenge you like and try to solve at least one in order to evaluate
you.

You can send the repository with your code to this [email](mailto:eduardo@nuclea.solutions)
and we will get back to you.

The challenges are:

- [Autonomous Driving](/challenges/autonomous-driving/challenge.md)

Most of the challenges don't give you a "straight" line about how to do something,
we might give you some hints about ways to approach the problem but part of the
goal is to see what your thinking process looks like and how creative you can
get solving them.
