# Autonomous Driving

The goal is to control a drone in a simulated environment and be able to
take decisions about what path it should take given a target destination.

The navigation algorithm you pick can depend on:

- LiDAR
- Depth Camera
- Any other sensor/device you like

Your implementation can be based on famous algorithms such as:

- A*
- D* Lite

For simulation enviroments you can use something like:

- Gazebo (we use this one)

The environment a fair amount of obstacles to avoid such as

- 2 buildings
- 6 light poles

The target destination must have to go through that environment.
