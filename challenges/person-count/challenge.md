# Person Count

This challenge consists on identifying different people across different cameras
meaning a person can appear on different cameras but your algorithm should identify it
as one. For the implementation you can use a mix of using a [YOLO](https://www.ultralytics.com/yolo)
to identify people and do a classic algorithm to detect how "similar" people
are based on color, create a machine learning algorithm to identify how close two
people are from each other, etc.; get creative.

For the dataset for the images you can use the [this](https://github.com/Nuclea-Solutions/person-dataset)
